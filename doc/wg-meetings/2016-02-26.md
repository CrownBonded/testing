## Minutes

###How to motivate people to fix tests (Alexis)

* Alexis: Flaky tests should be the responsibility of all collaborators. How do we make that happen? v8 team has a freeze if there are too many flaky tests for too long, making it the interest of everyone who wants to merge changes to resolve flaky tests. That may be too extreme for us, but we should think of *something* and this deserves an issue in the testing repo.

### Revise Flaky Test wiki page (Rich/Alexis) https://github.com/nodejs/testing/issues/13

* See above item.

### Skipped Test Catalog

* Alexis: We have many skipped tests and no catalog of the tests and why they are skipped. Perhaps we can use the status files?
* Rich: Maybe I can put this in a Roadmap doc and we can talk about the Roadmap doc next time.

### Single stress testing of parallel tests in parallel https://github.com/nodejs/testing/issues/3

* João: Perhaps I can post the scripts for Santi and he can work on them locally and send them back to me and I can post it as a Jenkins job.
* Santi: That will work.
* João: Great. Send it by mail or however you want.

### CI results searching via automation or... https://github.com/nodejs/testing/issues/7

* Not much to report right now.

### Flaky tests https://github.com/nodejs/testing/issues/11

* Rich: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4427 (will tag v8 folks)
* Santi: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/5368 (tagged v8 folks)

### Meeting time: Santi is asking if we can move the meeting one hour later if possible.

* No problems from any of the attendees.

### Charter: Rich is going to find out the next steps and try to push things forward, unless anyone has objections.

* Alexis: You will need Build WG ratification too in addition to CTC or TSC.

### Experimental Jenkins

* Alexis: Build WG discussed creating a separate instance of Jenkins for experimentation which might be usable by the Testing WG. Unfortunately, Build WG is pressed for time, unfortunately. But if someone wants to do that work, the Build WG would love to have your help.
* Santi: I am interested.
* Alexis: Great! Ping João or Johan on #node-build.
