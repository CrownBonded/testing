## Minutes

### Meeting time
* Will make it one hour earlier next time, and going forward

### We are chartered!
* Hooray!

### Roadmap
* https://github.com/nodejs/testing/pull/25
* Jo達o: Should tests that use timeouts automatically go in sequential rather than parallel? (See 10:22 in the recording for the conversation.)

* Some discussion around tagging things `good-first-contribution`
* Some discussion around checking commit messages on CLI and CI
* Santi requested that people review https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/5368
  * Should it go to known issues?
  * Should it be marked as flaky? (Need to be marked flaky on all platforms.)
* Can we make it so we can mark just the Raspberry Pi devices as flaky for a test and not all Linux issues?
  * Jo達o thinks it is possible, but it will require some work.
